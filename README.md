# Jainam's Python Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing various Python projects I've worked on. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, machine learning, and data analysis. Below are brief descriptions of each project along with links to detailed documentation, images, and videos.

## Project 1: JARVIS - An Interactive Assistant
The JARVIS project aims to create a versatile virtual assistant that leverages advanced technologies to perform a wide range of functions. These functions include media playback control, opening different applications, accessing emails, setting alarm, getting information about current affairs, checking time and temperature. The assistant is designed to be highly interactive and user-friendly, making use of both voice commands and gesture recognition.

### Features:
- Weather updates
- Music control
- Task scheduling
- Translation services
- And more...

## Project 2: Media Control with Hand Gesture
This project involves a media player control system using a Convolutional Neural Network for hand gesture recognition. It allows users to control media playback through intuitive hand movements using 7 distinct hand gestures.

### Features:
- Hand gesture recognition using CNN
- Media playback control
- High accuracy of 98%

## Project 3: Fitness Tracker with ML
A fitness tracker project focusing on real-world applications in fitness tracking. It involves creating Python scripts to process, visualize, and model accelerometer and gyroscope data to classify barbell exercises and count repetitions.

### Features:
- Data processing and visualization
- Exercise classification using ML models
- Repetition counting

## Project 4: Quora Question Pair
This project aims to determine whether a pair of questions on Quora are semantically similar. The primary objective is to explore patterns and trends in the question pairs and develop a model that accurately identifies similar questions. This analysis helps enhance the user experience on Quora by reducing redundant questions and improving information retrieval efficiency.

### Features:
- Analysis of question pairs
- Pattern and trend exploration
- Model development for identifying similar questions
